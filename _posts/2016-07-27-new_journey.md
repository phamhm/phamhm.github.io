#New Journey#

This week, I came to the realization thtat I am going to change my life. This starts with finding a new job.

The last job finding was arduous and I promise it will not happen again. I am going to record my journey in this blog.

This job search will be more scientific and data driven. I realize that I can rely on commericial product (monsters.com, careerbuilder.com). Having a data driven approach will help me measure the progress more objectively.
